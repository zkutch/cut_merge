Often we just need to cut a piece from a video file or cut several pieces from a video file or several video files and glue them together. The main problem is transcoding, which takes a lot of time and resources - and this utility solves this problem.
By calling the utility, you first simply specify how many pieces you need to cut and glue. Then for each chunk you give the file address, start time and duration.

The utility creates temporary renumbered files for all cut pieces, and in the last, largest, number there will be already glued pieces.

The utility is based on ffmpeg
